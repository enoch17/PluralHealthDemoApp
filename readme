PluralHealth Demo Application

PluralHealth Demo Application is a .NET Web API built to demonstrate backend design for a small healthcare system.
The project focuses on appointments, patients, invoicing, payments, role-based access, facility scoping, validation, logging, filtering, and pagination.

This implementation is intentionally kept in-memory (no database) to focus on architecture, clarity, and correctness, rather than infrastructure setup.

Key Features Implemented
Appointment listing with:
+Time window filtering (default: today)
+Clinic filtering
+Text search (patient name, code, phone)
+Sorting by appointment time
+Pagination with total count
+Appointment creation (front desk role)
+Patient wallet and currency display
+Role-based access control
+Facility (clinic) scoping
+Validation and meaningful error handling
+Clear empty-state and error responses

Assumptions Made

To keep the scope realistic but manageable, the following assumptions were made:

1. Authentication & Users

Authentication is simulated, not fully implemented.

A lightweight UserContext is injected into services to represent:

Username

Role (Admin, FrontDesk, Staff)

Clinic (facility)

No database-backed User model is created, since the goal is to demonstrate authorization logic, not identity management.

2. Roles

Three roles are supported for demo purposes:

Admin – Full access

FrontDesk – Can create appointments, invoices, and process payments

Staff – Read-only access to appointment listings

Role checks are enforced inside services, not controllers, to keep business rules centralized.

3. Facility Scoping

Facility scoping means:

A user can only access or create data belonging to their assigned clinic.

Examples:

A FrontDesk user assigned to Ikeja cannot create or view appointments for Lekki

Admin users can access all clinics

This is enforced in the service layer using the injected UserContext.

4. Data Storage

All data is stored in static in-memory collections

Appointments, patients, invoices, and payments are pre-seeded

This avoids database complexity and keeps the demo focused on logic and structure
